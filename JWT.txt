Thread Dump

As it turns out, there are many ways to capture a thread dump using JDK utilities. Let's take a moment to reflect on each and outline their pros and cons:

jstack: provides the quickest and easiest way to capture a thread dump; however, better alternatives are available starting with Java 8
jmc: enhanced JDK profiling and diagnostics tool. It minimizes the performance overhead that's usually an issue with profiling tools.
jvisualvm: lightweight and open-source profiling tool with an excellent GUI console
jcmd: extremely powerful and recommended for Java 8 and later. A single tool that serves many purposes: capturing thread dump (jstack), heap dump (jmap), system properties, and command-line arguments (jinfo)
jconsole: lets us inspect thread stack trace information
